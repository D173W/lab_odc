Image and video generated in Assembly emulating a RPi3 (with Clemente Ivetta &amp; Ignacio Hernandez)

The first thing we did was understand how the frame buffer works and design the image to replicate using Legv8 code.
Once completed we went on to create the basic functions we needed and define our way of working separately on the project, we learned GIT in the process. Then each one finished his part and we assembled

For the video what we did was understand how to make each "frame" (painting and unpainting and delays)
We finish with Clemente implementing gravity on the ball
